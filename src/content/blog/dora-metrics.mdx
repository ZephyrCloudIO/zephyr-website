**A founder we know paid $150K for six months of “work” and all he got were some Jira tickets.**

_Let that sink in._

It was his first startup. His first technical hire. And a very expensive lesson in the illusion of productivity.

## When It Looks Like Work, But Nothing Ships

We knew a founder and like many first-time founders, he was juggling product, pitching, fundraising, hiring, everything and trusting that the “engineering” part was handled.

The engineer? Always present in meetings. Always updating Jira. A steady stream of backlog grooming. On paper, it looked like progress.

But nothing ever made it to production.

It wasn’t until he brought on a second founding engineer, someone who actually shipped features, pushed code, and asked hard questions that the illusion started to crack.

The first hire hadn’t written a single line of code. The product hadn’t moved an inch.

Because there were no real ways to measure engineering output, the illusion held for a long six months.

Six months. $150,000. Burned.

## What If This Was Happening at Scale?

Now imagine that same story playing out at the enterprise scale. Not one ghost engineer dozen. Maybe hundreds. People showing up to meetings, updating Jira,
moving cards… but never shipping. And no one notices, because it all _looks_ like work.

You can’t throw another senior dev at the problem just to watch over developers shoulders. What you need is **real visibility into who’s actually delivering.**

That’s where **DORA metrics** come in.

- **Change Failure Rate** – How often are your deploys breaking things?
- **Lead Time for Changes** – How long from code to production?
- **Deployment Frequency** – How often are you shipping?
- **Mean Time to Recover** – How fast do you fix things when they break?

Used properly, these metrics tell a simple story: is your team actually shipping software, or just looking busy?

**At Zephyr Cloud, We Track This by Default**

At Zephyr Cloud, we believe in tracking DORA Metrics and have built them into the core platform.

If you’re building with **micro-frontends**, this is essential. When every team owns their own piece of the UI, you need to know which parts are moving and what’s stalling.

No vibes. No micromanaging. Just the real data and real shipping with complete visibility and no more ghosts.
