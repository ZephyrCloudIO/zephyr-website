This release introduces a redesigned navigation experience, enhanced deployment workflows, multi-org subscription support, improved tagging & condition logic, and updated worker infrastructure

## New User Navigation

We completely redesigned the navigation experience to make Zephyr easier to use:

- Cleaner layout & faster access to key areas
- More intuitive grouping of features
- Improved behavior across environments and orgs

## Multi-Organization & Subscription Enhancements

- Big update: Zephyr now supports multi-org subscriptions, allowing you to link multiple organizations under a single parent account.

## Worker & Deployment Improvements

- We released a new Akamai Worker version (v0.1.2) with cache control updates
- Improved worker ordering, schema handling, and remote environment updates

## Tags & Conditions

- A redesigned tag filtering UI is now available, along with improvements to the tagging API. We also resolved an issue that caused user IDs to display incorrectly in tag lists.
