# Timestamps & Filters on Versions

Managing versions just got a whole lot easier! We've added timestamps and powerful filtering capabilities to help you track, review, and manage your application versions more effectively.

## Version Timestamps

Every version now displays when it was created, giving you instant visibility into your deployment timeline.

### What's New:

- **Creation timestamps**: See exactly when each version was built
- **Relative time display**: Quick glance shows "2 hours ago" or "3 days ago"
- **Absolute time on hover**: Get precise date and time information
- **Timezone support**: Times displayed in your local timezone

### Benefits:

- **Deployment tracking**: Understand your deployment frequency
- **Debugging aid**: Correlate issues with specific deployment times
- **Audit trail**: Complete history of when changes were made
- **Team coordination**: Everyone knows when the latest version was deployed

## Advanced Filtering

Find the exact version you need with our new filtering system.

### Filter Options:

#### By Time

- **Today**: See all versions from the last 24 hours
- **This Week**: Versions from the current week
- **This Month**: All versions from the current month
- **Custom Range**: Select specific date ranges
- **Relative Filters**: "Last 7 days", "Last 30 days", etc.

#### By Status

- **Active**: Currently running versions
- **Building**: Versions being built right now
- **Failed**: Versions that encountered errors
- **Archived**: Older versions kept for reference
- **All**: See everything at once

### Combination Filters

Combine multiple filters for precise results:

- "Failed builds from last week"
- "Active versions deployed today"
- "All versions from December 2024"

- See deployment times to identify when issues started
- One-click rollback to any previous version

### Better Reviews

- Review all deployments from a specific period
- Track deployment frequency and patterns
- Identify peak deployment times

### Improved Debugging

- Correlate issues with deployment times
- Find versions deployed around incident times
- Track down when problematic code was introduced
