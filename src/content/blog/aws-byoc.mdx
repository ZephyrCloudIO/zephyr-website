In today's fast-moving digital world, choosing the right cloud is about more than cost—it's about control, flexibility, and the freedom to innovate without being locked in. At Zephyr, we've always believed that your cloud strategy should be your strategy, not something dictated by vendors or technical limitations.

That's why **Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)** has been at the heart of Zephyr from day one. BYOC means you can:
- Stay in control of your own infrastructure
- Keep your data secure within your perimeter
- Make the most of your existing cloud investments
- Scale on your terms

We've already supported major providers like Cloudflare, Netlify, Akamai, and Fastly. But one key player was still missing — **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

## Why AWS? Why Now?

AWS is one of the most widely used cloud providers in the world. Many of our customers already rely on it for their infrastructure, and they wanted the same seamless Zephyr experience there. Adding AWS to our BYOC lineup was not just a natural next step—it was a strategic move to give our users even more freedom.

## The Journey Behind the Scenes

Bringing AWS into Zephyr Cloud wasn't just about “plugging it in.” Every cloud is different, and integrating AWS meant designing a solution that feels effortless for users, but is deeply robust under the hood.

Along the way, our team had to tackle challenges ranging from how files are handled and stored to how performance is optimized for large, multi-environment projects. We fine-tuned the process, optimized performance, and even redesigned parts of the flow to make it faster and more reliable.

After several rounds of testing and thorough code reviews, we achieved a seamless and reliable AWS integration that delivers the BYOC experience as intended.

## What Does This Mean for You?

With AWS now fully integrated, Zephyr Cloud users can:
- Deploy faster on infrastructure they already trust
- Reduce operational friction with a ready-to-use setup
- Keep their data and processes aligned with internal policies
- Scale globally with the power of AWS—while staying in control

Whether you're a startup looking for cost-efficient scale or a large enterprise running complex environments, this integration opens the door to even more flexibility.

## Ready to Get Started?

AWS integration is live and ready for you to explore. Check out our documentation [here](https://docs.zephyr-cloud.io/cloud/aws) to learn how to enable it and start using your AWS infrastructure with Zephyr Cloud.

The cloud should empower you — not limit you. With AWS now part of the Zephyr BYOC family, that vision just became even stronger.
