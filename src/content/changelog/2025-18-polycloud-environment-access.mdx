This release introduces enhanced environment access controls, an updated project overview dashboard, improved UML visualization with version support, and subscription management capabilities.

## Environment Access Controls

Manage access to your environments with new granular controls:

- New tag condition for environments allowing precise access control rules
- Protected environment flag to safeguard production and critical environments
- New environment members section for managing team access at the environment level

This gives you fine-grained control over who can access and modify specific environments in your organization.

## Project Level Overview

We've updated the project overview page with enhanced application data display, giving you better visibility into your project's applications and their status at a glance.

## UML with Versions

Enhanced dependency visualization in the UML view:

- Version selector for viewing remote dependency trees
- Tree visualization of remote dependencies based on ZephyrDependencies
- Tag and environment filtering for more focused dependency analysis

## Subscription Management

Cancel subscriptions directly from your dashboard:

- Cancel subscriptions immediately or schedule cancellation at the end of your billing cycle
- Better control over your subscription lifecycle

## Bug Fixes & UI Improvements

- Fixed org switcher viewport positioning when resizing browser windows
- Corrected version search placeholder text when creating tags
- Removed duplicate variable tab in the UI
