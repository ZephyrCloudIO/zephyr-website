# Akamai Integration, Audit Logs & Enhanced Security

We're excited to announce a significant platform update that brings enterprise-grade CDN capabilities, comprehensive audit logging, and enhanced security defaults to Zephyr Cloud.

## Akamai CDN Integration

### What's New:
- **Native Akamai Support**: Deploy your applications directly to Akamai's global edge network
- **One-Click Integration**: Simple setup process with automatic configuration
- **Edge Computing**: Run your applications closer to users for improved performance
- **Global Distribution**: Leverage Akamai's extensive CDN infrastructure

### Benefits:
- Reduced latency with edge deployment
- Improved scalability for high-traffic applications
- Enhanced security with Akamai's DDoS protection
- Automatic SSL/TLS certificate management

### Getting Started:
Check out our new [Akamai integration documentation](https://docs.zephyr-cloud.io/cloud/akamai) to start deploying to Akamai's edge network today.

## Environment Audit Logs

### Features:
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Every environment action is now logged
- **Detailed History**: Track deployments, configuration changes, and access patterns
- **API Access**: Query audit logs programmatically for automation
- **UI Integration**: View audit logs directly in the dashboard

### Use Cases:
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Debugging deployment issues
- Security incident investigation
- Team activity monitoring

## Enhanced Security Defaults

### Privacy-First Approach:
- **Private by Default**: New organizations, projects, and applications now default to private visibility
- **Explicit Sharing**: Requires intentional action to make resources public
- **Improved Access Control**: Better protection for sensitive projects

### Additional Security Updates:
- Deprecated Auth0 props in application configuration for improved security
- Enhanced error handling for authentication failures
- Improved 403 error page behavior to prevent infinite redirects

## Developer Experience Improvements

### Plugin Updates (v0.0.55 & v0.0.56):
- **Create-Zephyr-Apps**: Added Airbnb clone template for quick prototyping
- **Git Integration**: Improved default git scenario fallbacks
- **Remote Resolution**: Enhanced logging for dependency resolution
- **Build Improvements**: Fixed root and output directory definitions

### Platform Enhancements:
- **Intercom Chat**: Built-in support chat for immediate assistance
- **Rollback Modal**: Added direct links for easier navigation
- **Deployment Integration**: Improved environment deployment workflows
- **Status Indicators**: Better visibility for application states

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

### Resolved Issues:
- Fixed custom DNS name parsing errors
- Resolved application recreation issues after project deletion
- Fixed simultaneous deployment conflicts across environments
- Improved handling of undefined labels in the UI
- Fixed webpack version mismatches

### Performance Optimizations:
- Terraform plan execution now uses parallelism for faster processing
- Improved deployment log error reporting
- Enhanced integration cleanup on error conditions

## What's Next?

We're continuing to invest in making Zephyr Cloud the most developer-friendly deployment platform. Coming soon:
- Expanded CDN provider integrations
- Advanced audit log filtering and analytics
- Enhanced team collaboration features
- More starter templates for create-zephyr-apps

Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, we'd love to hear your feedback!
