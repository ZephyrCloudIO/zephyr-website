# Yearly Subscriptions Introduced & UML Graph Upgraded

We're excited to announce two major updates that enhance both your billing experience and application visualization capabilities.

## New Subscription Improvements

We've rolled out several updates to make managing your subscription smoother and more transparent:

### Yearly Plans with Clear Savings

Now when selecting a yearly plan, you'll see exactly how much you save in dollars — no more generic percentages!

- **Monthly**: "Save X% with annual"
- **Yearly**: "You're saving $X/year!"

### Better Payment UI

- Payment method cards are now fully responsive
- Clear visual highlight for your current plan
- Inputs now include sensible limits to avoid accidental entries

### Seat Management Made Easier

- **Switching plans?** Your seat count will now be preserved
- **New "Force Downgrade" option** lets you take action immediately, with a confirmation step for safety

## UML Graph Just Got Smarter

We've improved the UML graph for applications to give you a faster and more accurate view of your architecture:

### Faster & More Focused

- New backend endpoint delivers only the data needed for the graph — no extra load!

### Smarter Visuals

- **New graph engine** using ReactFlow
- **Support for showing apps** across different projects and organizations
- **Cleaner styling** and support for incomplete node rendering

### Refined User Experience

- Streamlined application details view
- Optimized layout and positioning of nodes

## What This Means for You

### Subscription Benefits

- **Transparent savings**: Know exactly how much you save with yearly plans

- **Flexible management**: Preserve your settings when switching plans

### Enhanced Architecture Visualization

- **Performance boost**: Faster loading with optimized data delivery

- **Cleaner interface**: Focus on what matters with improved styling
