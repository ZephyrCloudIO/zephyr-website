When we wrapped up our first launch week back in September 2024 it took only a few moments to realize that we loved the experience and wanted to do a second one.

The question came up from the team as to what we would focus on. We had a few events and trips coming up and the hope was that these trips would help us to really center on a key idea.

It was the feedback we got from some folks at an Acceleration week on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7266271083094282240/) together with the fun we had working with the [Callstack](https://www.callstack.com/) team that solidified the theme: <strong>"Mobile First"</strong>.

With that we began planning and working backwards from this week.

Before we dive into the content from our team I would love for you to take a few moments to listen to [this RedMonk podcast](https://redmonk.com/blog/2025/01/27/rmc-zack-chapple-on-zephyr-cloud-micro-frontends-and-module-federation/) with [Dr. Kate Holterhoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kateholterhoff/).
