# Yearly Subscriptions, UML Graphs & Platform Improvements

We're excited to announce a comprehensive update that enhances the billing experience, developer tools, and platform infrastructure in Zephyr Cloud.

## New Subscription Improvements

Managing your subscription is now easier and more transparent with the following updates:

### Yearly Plans

Save 15% by switching to an annual plan. You get the same benefits at a lower yearly price.

### Improved UI

- **Responsive Design:** Payment method cards are now fully responsive for desktop and mobile.
- **Clear Highlighting:** Your current plan is now visually highlighted for at-a-glance clarity.
- **Input Validation:** Form fields now include validation to prevent invalid data entry.

### Simplified Seat Management

- **Plan Switching:** Your seat count is now automatically preserved when you switch between plans.
- **Billing Clarity:** The UI now clearly shows your total paid seats versus your currently used seats.

## UML Graph Improvements

Visualizing applications and dependencies is now faster and more accurate than ever before.

### What's New:

- **Dedicated API endpoint**: Introduced a specialized graph API for fetching linked applications across organizations/projects
- **ReactFlow-powered engine**: Brand new UML graph component built with ReactFlow for superior performance and flexibility
- **Modular architecture**: Node/edge calculators separated from rendering logic for better maintainability
- **Enhanced visibility**: Graph now displays incomplete nodes so you see the full picture
- **Improved performance**: Enhanced layout styling and optimized rendering
- **Better navigation**: Updated application details panel for easier exploration

### Benefits:

- **Faster loading times**: Optimized data delivery means less waiting, more building
- **Cross-organization insights**: See relationships across your entire infrastructure
- **Cleaner interface**: Focus on what matters with improved styling and layout
- **Better debugging**: Incomplete nodes help identify missing dependencies

## Platform & Developer Experience

Beyond the major features above, we've made several improvements to enhance the development workflow:

### Infrastructure Improvements

- **Intercom integration**: Converted Intercom to a microfrontend for better modularity
- **Plugin updates**: Upgraded the Zephyr plugin with the latest improvements and bug fixes

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

We've also addressed several issues to improve stability and performance:

- **Polyrepo graph fixes**: Resolved issues with polyrepo graph visualization
- **Yearly subscription adjustments**: Fixed edge cases in the new yearly subscription flow
- **Affected Tags and Environments deployments**: A retry policy is now implemented in occasional tags/environments deployment failures due to points-of-presence latency in propagation

Your feedback drives these improvements. Let us know what you'd like to see next!
