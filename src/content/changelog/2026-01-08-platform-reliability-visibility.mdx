This release delivers a set of improvements focused on increasing platform reliability, enhancing observability, and refining deployment workflows. It also introduces UI and API enhancements across environments, tags, UML visualization, and feedback experiences to support smoother day-to-day operations.

## Deployment & Environment Reliability

We’ve improved deployment behavior and environment consistency to make releases more predictable and easier to manage:

- Corrected environment deployments triggered by tags
- Ensured deleted environments are properly reflected across the platform
- Improved accuracy of connector type previews in tag conditions

## UML Visualization Improvements

The UML experience has been refined to improve clarity and readability:

- Removed incomplete nodes from the default view
- Improved node positioning for clearer and more intuitive diagrams
- Improved Visibility & Monitoring

## Improved Visibility & Monitoring

We’ve enhanced system visibility to help teams better understand platform health and performance:

- Expanded system metrics for deeper performance insight
- Clearer health indicators to help identify issues earlier and operate with confidence

## Better Filtering & Navigation

Finding and managing resources is now easier with improved filtering and navigation:

- Git tag filtering for faster version discovery
- Improved filtering across application versions and environment logs
- More accurate previews when configuring tag-based conditions

## New Feedback Experience

We’ve introduced a more structured and accessible way to share feedback:

- New feedback system with topic selection
- Improved visibility and accessibility of feedback entry within the platform

## Performance & Stability Enhancements

- Platform-wide performance and stability improvements for a smoother, more reliable experience
