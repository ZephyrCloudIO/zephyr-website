# Yearly Subscriptions, UML Graphs & Platform Improvements

We're excited to announce a comprehensive update that enhances the billing experience, developer tools, and platform infrastructure in Zephyr Cloud.

## New Subscription Improvements

We've rolled out several improvements to make managing your subscription easier and more transparent:

### Clearer Yearly Plan Savings
When choosing a yearly plan, you'll now see exactly how much you're saving in dollars â€” no more vague percentages.

### Improved Payment UI
- **Fully responsive design**: Payment method cards now work seamlessly on mobile and desktop
- **Clear visual cues**: Your current plan is highlighted so you always know where you stand
- **Smart input validation**: Input fields include sensible limits to prevent accidental entries

### Simplified Seat Management
- **Preserve your settings**: Switching plans? Your seat count is now automatically preserved
- **Flexible downgrading**: A new "Force Downgrade" option lets you take immediate action with a confirmation step for safety

## UML Graph Improvements

Visualizing applications and dependencies is now faster and more accurate than ever before.

### What's New:
- **Dedicated API endpoint**: Introduced a specialized graph API for fetching linked applications across organizations/projects
- **ReactFlow-powered engine**: Brand new UML graph component built with ReactFlow for superior performance and flexibility
- **Modular architecture**: Node/edge calculators separated from rendering logic for better maintainability
- **Enhanced visibility**: Graph now displays incomplete nodes so you see the full picture
- **Improved performance**: Enhanced layout styling and optimized rendering
- **Better navigation**: Updated application details panel for easier exploration

### Benefits:
- **Faster loading times**: Optimized data delivery means less waiting, more building
- **Cross-organization insights**: See relationships across your entire infrastructure
- **Cleaner interface**: Focus on what matters with improved styling and layout
- **Better debugging**: Incomplete nodes help identify missing dependencies

## Platform & Developer Experience

Beyond the major features above, we've made several improvements to enhance the development workflow:

### Infrastructure Improvements
- **Intercom integration**: Converted Intercom to a microfrontend for better modularity
- **Plugin updates**: Upgraded the Zephyr plugin with the latest improvements and bug fixes

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

We've also addressed several issues to improve stability and performance:

- **Polyrepo graph fixes**: Resolved issues with polyrepo graph visualization
- **Yearly subscription adjustments**: Fixed edge cases in the new yearly subscription flow
- **Affected Tags and Environments deployments**: A retry policy is now implemented in occasional tags/environments deployment failures due to points-of-presence latency in propagation

## What's Next?

We're continuing to enhance subscription management, visualization tools, and platform capabilities:
- Advanced billing analytics and usage insights
- Interactive graph filtering and search capabilities
- Custom graph layouts and export options
- More granular subscription controls

Your feedback drives these improvements. Let us know what you'd like to see next!
