# Zephyr Cloud Updates: Yearly Plans & A Rebuilt Graph Engine

This month's update brings two major changes to Zephyr Cloud: new yearly subscription plans to help you save, and a complete, ground-up rebuild of our UML graph engine for a massive leap in performance and capability.

## Subscription & Billing Updates

You can now switch your subscription to a yearly plan and save 15%. It’s the same service, just more cost-effective for long-term users. We also took this opportunity to refine the billing experience. Your seat count is now preserved when switching plans, and the UI provides a much clearer breakdown of used versus paid seats. The interface itself is now fully responsive and includes better input validation.

## UML Graph Engine Rebuilt

We've re-architected our UML graph visualization from scratch. The new engine, built on ReactFlow, is significantly faster and more flexible. This was a major undertaking involving a new dedicated API for fetching cross-project application links, which is the primary driver for the new speed. The result is a faster, more capable tool for debugging and understanding your architecture.

*   The rendering logic is now decoupled from node/edge calculation for better maintainability.
*   Incomplete nodes are now displayed to help you spot missing dependencies.
*   The application details panel and layout styling have been updated for better navigation.

## Platform, Fixes, & DX Improvements

We also shipped several key updates to improve stability and the developer experience. Here are the highlights:

*   Deployments that fail due to CDN propagation latency will now automatically retry up to three times with exponential backoff, improving deployment success rates.
*   Resolved a bug where graph edges would fail to render between services located in different repositories, which also caused node overlapping issues.
*   Corrected a proration calculation error that occurred when switching from a monthly to a yearly plan mid-cycle.
*   Converted our Intercom integration into a microfrontend, which reduces the main application's bundle size and improves in-app load times.

### What's Next

Here’s a brief look at what’s on our immediate roadmap:

*   A new, lower-priced Team plan
*   Interactive graph filtering and search
*   Custom graph layouts and export options
*   More granular billing controls and usage analytics
