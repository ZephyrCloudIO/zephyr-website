## Summary

This update focuses on the workflows teams use every day: setting up deployment integrations, managing environments and tags, working from organization dashboards, and handling team access. You should see faster screens, clearer UI, and more predictable behavior across these areas.

## Deployment Integrations

- Added support for **Kubernetes deployment integrations** (enterprise availability), including stronger validation and health checks during setup.
- Improved reliability when creating and updating deployment integrations, especially in edge cases.
- Improved deployment integration list performance for larger organizations, with much faster loading on integration-heavy accounts.

## Environments and Tag Flows

- You can now create environments **without pinning a specific version**, which improves tag-driven environment workflows.
- Improved handling of nullable/optional environment versions to prevent creation and editing failures.
- Improved tag condition and filtering performance, making large tag sets more responsive in listing and resolution flows.

## Organization and Application UI

- Organization overview now surfaces clearer summary information and more polished recent-application cards.
- Recent application cards now use live counters and tighter layouts for quicker scanning.
- Settings and actions in overview cards were repositioned for better visual hierarchy.
- Environment condition forms in applications were improved so long version values are easier to read and edit.

## Authentication and Permissions

- Added a direct `/logout` route flow and improved login/logout screen presentation.
- Login and logout routes now render without app shell chrome for a cleaner auth experience.
- Fixed team management permission behavior so edit actions match expected role access.

## Performance Improvements

- Improved project-list responsiveness for organizations with larger project/application counts.
- Improved deployment integration endpoint response times in high-volume orgs.

## What This Means for Teams

- No migration steps required.
- Existing workflows remain compatible.
- Teams should notice faster dashboard and integration screens, fewer setup issues, and clearer day-to-day management UX.
