# Dependency Management & Rspress Plugin Running SSG

We're excited to announce two major features that make building distributed applications with Zephyr even more powerful and flexible.

## Zephyr Dependency Management

First, we've rolled out **Zephyr Dependency Management**, a powerful new feature that simplifies how your applications handle external modules. Now you can:

### 1. Easily specify remote dependencies

Define external modules in your `package.json` to have them loaded dynamically from other applications. This enables true micro-frontend architecture without the complexity.

```json
{
  "zephyrDependencies": {
    "@remote/components": "https://app.zephyr-cloud.io/components@latest",
    "@remote/utils": "https://app.zephyr-cloud.io/utils@1.2.3"
  }
}
```

### 2. Benefit from intelligent resolution

Zephyr analyzes your app during build time to ensure only essential assets are bundled, while seamlessly fetching others. This results in:

- Smaller bundle sizes
- Faster initial load times
- Dynamic module loading when needed

### 3. Enjoy simplified setup

With minimal configuration, Zephyr handles remote loading and asset bundling, making distributed app development more efficient than ever. No complex webpack configurations or manual module federation setup required.

## withZephyr Rspress Plugin

Second, we've introduced the **`withZephyr` Rspress plugin**, along with an example showcasing its use with Static Site Generation (SSG). This new addition will help you leverage Rspress more effectively with Zephyr.

### Features

- Seamless integration with Rspress SSG workflow
- Automatic deployment to Zephyr Cloud
- Built-in optimizations for static sites
- Support for dynamic content injection

### Quick Start

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'rspress/config';
import { withZephyr } from '@zephyr-cloud/rspress-plugin';

export default defineConfig(
  withZephyr({
    // Your Rspress config
  }),
);
```

## What's Next?

These features are part of our ongoing commitment to making distributed application development simpler and more efficient. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance the Zephyr platform.
