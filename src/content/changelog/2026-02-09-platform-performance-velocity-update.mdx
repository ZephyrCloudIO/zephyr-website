## Summary

This release represents a substantial internal evolution of the Zephyr platform. It delivers foundational improvements across architecture, performance, and developer workflows to increase engineering velocity, improve end-user performance, and unlock more effective use of AI across the platform. These changes meaningfully raise the ceiling for how quickly, reliably, and efficiently Zephyr deploys innovation.

Outside of bug fixes, user-facing functionality remains unchanged.

## What Changed

- **Core platform refactoring**: Simplified and standardized internal platform structure to reduce complexity and improve maintainability across services and interfaces.
- **AI-assisted development enablement**: Updated internal schemas, contracts, and workflows to improve compatibility with AI-assisted tooling and automation used by the engineering team.
- **Performance optimizations**: Improved request handling, data access patterns, and runtime efficiency across critical paths.
- **Build and delivery improvements**: Optimized asset generation and delivery to reduce bundle sizes and improve load performance.
- **Bug fixes and stability work**: Addressed a wide range of issues across APIs, UI, and deployment flows to improve overall reliability.

## Key Outcomes

- **Faster engineering iteration**: Reduced friction in development and deployment, enabling quicker and safer delivery of changes.
- **Improved AI accessibility for the team**: More consistent internal interfaces and data structures that better support AI-assisted development workflows.
- **Better end-user performance**: Faster load times and improved responsiveness across common user flows.
- **Smaller client bundles**: Reduced payload sizes and more efficient asset loading.
- **Increased platform stability**: Fewer edge-case failures and more predictable system behavior.

## User Impact

- No changes to existing features or workflows.
- Users may notice incremental improvements in performance and responsiveness.
- Active monitoring is in place during rollout.

## What's Next

Follow-up releases next week will build on this foundation with additional improvements.
