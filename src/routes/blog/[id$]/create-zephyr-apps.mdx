TLDR' - we simplified where you can find almost all our examples. Anyone can scaffold a federated cross-platform application with a single command:

```bash
npx create-zephyr-apps@latest
```

[Read about how to use this CLI.](https://docs.zephyr-cloud.io/recipes/repack-mf)

(we will talk about how we dogfood our own product next time)

"Right right so we got 120mins CI on cross-platform app, how can we fix that?"

"Merge freeze guys! Before we found out what's the issue NO ONE SHOULD BE MERGING"

"Mate my team gotta ship the new account management page"

The answer to all of the above questions is to build a modularized application. An application that is built in parallel and shipped in parallel. Using [Zephyr](https://docs.zephyr-cloud.io) +[ Rspack](https://rspack.dev) + [Re.Pack](https://github.com/callstack/repack) + [Module Federation](https://module-federation.io).

Our partner [Callstack](https://www.callstack.com/) has been experimenting with bundling React Native with Webpack over 5 years (ref: [Haul](https://github.com/callstack/haul)). Started as a command line tool, Haul's successor Re.Pack is now responsible for creating, handling Federation runtime and container reference for cross-platform application to split and bundle code - with much more utility toolset built-in (filtering rules for Flow type modules, Code generation rules, debugger support and so much more).

Half a year ago, when I asked Re.Pack's maintainer Jakub, "So how do you guys deploy federated cross-platform apps before Zephyr?"

#### He told me "EVERYONE IS DOING THEIR OWN HACK."

###### Oh dear.

Zephyr came in as the federated application orchestration toolchain, to help cross-platform applications version, bundle, and deploy remote applications - updates MiniApps on Host application, allowing developers to ship with freedom.

How developers would publish an app to App Stores doesn't change. How cross-platform UI can be crafted stay the same ([you can use](https://x.com/_jbroma/status/1881452224305574233?s=46)...[NativeWind](https://x.com/_jbroma/status/1881452224305574233?s=46)!!!!) The changes happens in build configuration by replacing `metro.config.js` to `rspack.config.ts` - read more about the [how-to in our documentation](https://docs.zephyr-cloud.io/recipes/repack-mf).

We organised a hackathon-format event in one of our customers' office - broke the app in production (intentionally ofc), and rollback with Zephyr's [instant rollback feature](https://docs.zephyr-cloud.io/how-to/versioning-tags#version-rollback-and-roll-forward). After we shipped a PoC application (we also made a white label version of it btw, [the repo](https://github.com/ZephyrCloudIO/zephyr-repack-example) is here), they commented "You achieved what we wanted to do in the last 6 years in one week".

During that week, we created a cloud integration for the customer ([bring-your-own-cloud](https://docs.zephyr-cloud.io/cloud) btw) using [Fastly](https://fastly.com). Fastly is a great product. But we faced some issue on deployment, so we temperally 'toggled off' Fastly (quite literally) and 'toggled on' [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/) to make sure the deployment is able to continue.

To be honest, if we wanted to start gaming we could set up [however many environments](https://docs.zephyr-cloud.io/how-to/environments) for all the remote applications (both web and mobile) to play with them on the fly.

We also wanted to make what we did during that week available to anyone who wants to learn and understand - stay tuned for this week.

Our core libraries, code example, things ~~similar to~~ we shipped for the customers (tagging Callstack guys, ByteDance infra and Nx team) will be open sourced (if not already).

### We have a lot to build and A LOT TO SHARE - why not try `npx create-zephyr-apps@latest` today?
