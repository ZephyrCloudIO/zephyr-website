This release introduces enhanced environment access controls, an updated project overview dashboard, improved UML visualization with version support, and subscription management capabilities, along with infrastructure upgrades and bug fixes.

## Environment Access Controls

Manage access to your environments with new granular controls:

This gives you fine-grained control over who can access and modify specific environments in your organization.
